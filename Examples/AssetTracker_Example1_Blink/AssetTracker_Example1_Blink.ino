  MicroMod Asset Tracker Example
  ==============================

  Blink

  This example demonstrates how to initialize the pins on the MicroMod Asset Tracker
  and then blink the Processor Board STAT LED. Exciting stuff!

  The pins and ports are defined in AssetTrackerPins.ino.

  Please make sure that you have selected the correct Board using the Tools\Board menu:

  SparkFun ESP32 MicroMod  : Click here to get the boards: http://boardsmanager/All#ESP32 (Please install the Espressif ESP32 boards _and_ the SparkFun ESP32 boards)

  Special note for the ESP32:
    If you are using the ESP32 Processor Board, you must open the G3/IMU_PWR and G4/RI split pads on the rear of the PCB
    otherwise the PB will not be able to communicate with the SARA via serial.
